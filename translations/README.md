Hi. I noticed that some jTOS addons from jTOS manager doesn't have english translations:
https://github.com/JTosAddon/Tree-of-Savior-Addon-Manager/

I'll be translating some of the addons (based on requests or whenever I need to use them) on their latest released version from the manager, you can find them in my GitHub account:
https://github.com/librarianrabbit/tos-addons/tree/master/translations

DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of these addons, if you have anything against any addon listed here I'll remove or adjust this post accordingly. I am just trying to bring some useful tools from jTOS addons into iTOS if they don't have the english feature by themselves. All translations are adapted translations from Google Translation service.
