resistalert
--

Replaces the "Resist!" text with "This character or monster resisted a debuff." and adds a visual icon as reaction to whenever a monster or character (includes yourself) resists a debuff.  
This addon cannot know the difference between which skill was resisted or if it was a player or not, if the visual icon is bad for you it is possible to be disabled. The commands are: /resist balloon to disable the icon, /resist effect to disable the status effect text change.
