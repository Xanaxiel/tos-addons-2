Simpler version of [Mount 'er Good](https://github.com/FiftyCaliber/ToS-Addons/tree/master/addons/mountergood) by [FiftyCaliber](https://github.com/FiftyCaliber/ToS-Addons).

[WIP] This addon teleports your companion to your position if it's too far when trying to mount. In addition there's no change to the original behavior allowing you to ride Kabbalist's Merkabah.

Available commands:  
/cptoggle: Toggles the state of your companion.

Planned changes:  
Change command to /pet.  
Add command parameters 'on' and 'off' to change behavior instead of toggle.  
Toggle alerts on/off from /pet command.  
Change the alert behavior to be shown when the companion appears or disappears compared to the moment when command was called.  
Check if any companion is assigned to the character before calling TOGGLE_PET_ACTIVITY.
