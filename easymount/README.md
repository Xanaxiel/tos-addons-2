Simpler version of [Mount 'er Good](https://github.com/FiftyCaliber/ToS-Addons/tree/master/addons/mountergood) by [FiftyCaliber](https://github.com/FiftyCaliber/ToS-Addons).

[WIP] This addon teleports your companion to your position if it's too far when trying to mount. In addition there's no change to the original behavior allowing you to ride Kabbalist's Merkabah.

Available commands:  
/cptoggle: Toggles the state of your companion.

Planned changes:  
Toggle alerts on/off from /cptoggle command.  
Check if any companion is assigned to the character before calling TOGGLE_PET_ACTIVITY.
